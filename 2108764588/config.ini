info1="Zerra, being a skater, has very low friction, which causes her to lose almost no speed during attacks, but makes it hard to stop."
info2="As Zerra skates around, she leaves ice on the ground that, when she goes over it again, makes her move faster."
info3="Going faster makes Zerra's attacks do more damage, and makes her strongs do increased knockback too."
