AR..........


has no lore!!!!!!!!!!

but since you want lore so badly enough that you came all the way here in the files (or have read the changelog), i'm gonna paste this "idea" here


"one lore i thought up is that she fell thru a portal in swampy estuary like shovel knight did and ranno finding it out again
AR wasn't up for fight so ranno being a pacifist didn't either, and seeing as AR has an element similar to ranno, poison to acid, he let her stay at his place
but after some sparring ranno realizes acid isn't as similar as he once thought, acid actively destroying things as opposed to poison internally and slowly destroying, so ranno (gently) kicked AR out
since then AR's just been wandering around the lands of aether, seeing what kind of battle the inhabitant of this world are capable of"

idea paste over

few other notes:

yes she is "not my character" per se, the character herself is not mine
but i _did_ make this _playable_ character... if that makes any sense.

she used to have longer side-hair in the original design, but was cut short for animation convenience.

yes AR is a she. just cause she ain't got no skirts ain't mean she ain't no gurrrll.

her origin is not quite defined, but she claims she is from "a starry hilltop"; i have a stage for it in plans (i have a stage sketch here; https://i.imgur.com/f7CEE5C.png )

for how or why she came to the world of aether, it's a weird thought
i did have a plan to vaguely describe it in the intro anim, but i wanted to do it after i did this other planned character - but another character has taken priority over it for now


here's her specials' names pulled from old steam description:
"
Her Special moves include:

Neutral Special: Acid Paintbrush
Acid Rainbows uses her paintbrush to summon an acid-raincloud, raining acid rain down on the opponents.
The acid rain will then damage opponents overtime while they are exposed to it!

Side Special: Acid-JIS
She pulls from the illusory properties of an "acid" to float straight forward. She can't cancel out of it mid-move or anything, but she will have a super-armor while in her "JIS" form!

Up Special: Energy Bullets
She shoots a bunch of energy bullets downward, using the recoil to help with her vertical recovery.

Down Special: Lightning
She casts a lightning extending downward. When there are acid-rainclouds present, they will also cast lightning as well!
"

back-air: Kūrekijin

forward tilt: Ryūsōkyaku




she ain't my character, but i have some headcanons:

nah she ain't no edge. you just don't know her emotions because of the lack of her face.
she is aware of her short legs and is annoyed by it.
she's laid-back but ain't no misfit. not the type to throw out jokes all the time either.
she's serious, but not smug with it? has clearly distinguished seriousness from non-seriousness.

wait, is that edge?
hmm...
i'm just not good at writing out characters' personalities, ok?


so she has a slight conflict with ranno because of their powers' similar but different nature.
thinks there's few things in common with clairen (but not quite as she thinks). "an another time and an another world, pretty much the same thing, right?"
hyped for elliana because she feels revenge is pretty rad.


her sword i've dubbed "XaaaCi". i made the sword myself.
i've grown to associate this sword with her because i kept using this sword as AR avatar.
here is the original pixels; https://i.imgur.com/kRFn5GT.png
i've re-tuned its design for animation convenience, and her RoA sword i've dubbed "XaaaCi 0"

















i used to call her Arelle, btw. but it's an unofficial name.
