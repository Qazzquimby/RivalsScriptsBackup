All things must end. Disrupting the flow of life and death will attract the Ur-Mycota, spreading death and decay across the land and transforming those responsible into horrifying Mycoliches.

Mycolich is a slow, floaty grappler. Manipulate the forces of damage and death itself to your advantage. Gamble and pause your own damage percent while temporarily healing the opponent for combos. Keep them close with multiple moves that pull them towards you, and punish their overconfidence with a strong crouching block.
