name="Otto"
description="Otto is a powerful heavyweight with trap setups galore, but also the ability to hop on a motorcycle and chase down his foes. After dismounting the bike, you can launch it around with any move, including your chargeable billiard ball projectile. Several of his normal attacks also aid his mobility, such as a shoulder bash on FAir and BAir. Muno forgot to update the description after patching. Read the rest at https://pastebin.com/GvAP933x"
