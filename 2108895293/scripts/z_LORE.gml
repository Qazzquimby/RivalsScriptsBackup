/*

unlike Acid Rainbows, Lumina is my character proper, so i have some actual lore.

...quite unrelated to rivals lore, however.

Lumina Methuselah Flowlight
female, about age 7

A young child who lives alone in the deep forests of Nolwar, near a town.
She is attuned to Light magic, and that power alone is enough to get her through on daily chores - focused light for fire and heat, for example.
Usually calm, and sometimes blunt with her opinions, but she knows enough to try to care for others.
Her unusual early-age wisdom and her light magic is taught from her now-best-friend Kaili, who found Lumina lost in the forest, with all memories lost of her life before it.
