[general]
info3="Hitting enemies consecutively (or with f-smash) will drop hearts that the fragile King can use to recover health."
info2="King Knight's side special is his shoulder bash. Hitting a wall or enemy will send you into a spin, and bouncing on an enemy will refresh you dash."
info1="SPECIAL summons a rat bomb. Press SPECIAL again to turn the rat, or SPECIAL while it's airborne to detonate it."
