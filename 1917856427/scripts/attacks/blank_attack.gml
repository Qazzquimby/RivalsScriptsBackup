Liz's gimmick is ''Rhythm meter.'' It increases gradually after one of your hitboxes connect, when the
meter is full,the meter will turn yellow, meaning your next attack is going to deal more
damage and hitstun, some attacks have small changes when timed properly.

The other part of her gimmick is the ''Octave mechanic'' which makes your aerial attacks (and Nspecial) have extra
knockback. Dair doesn't have extra knockback, but it does a lot of damage.
