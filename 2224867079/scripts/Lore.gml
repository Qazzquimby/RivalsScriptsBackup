--- Chapter 1 ---

A long time ago in a very distant land. One being existed.
It had no purpose, no goals, not even a body. This being was known as lognes.
One day, Lognes created the two lesser beings to himself. The god of matter,
and the god of antimatter. Despite these gods having completely seperate ideals,
one could not exist without the other. Lognes gave them both 1 simple philosophy.
The god of matter simply wanted to create, the god of antimatter simply wanted to destroy.

--- Chapter 2 ---

A lot of time has passed since the gods' creation. Lognes completely taking the
role of spectator. Matter has created countless planets, stars, galaxies.
but no matter how many things Matter would make. Antimatter would always be there
to take it away. The planets matter created started to create life, the beings living
on these planets all took on a similar philosophy to matter. but for every bit of life
matter would create, similarly opposing creatures of antimatter would be given life.
all having the same philosophy as antimatter.

--- Chapter 3 ---

It was discovered that souls not possesing a body were out there in the world.
some of these each planet had one, and at any given time these souls could take
the physical form of one of the creatures on that planet. However some planets
had no life, souls without bodies. One of the beings created a mannequin which let
the souls take physical form. the mannequin would shape itself into what that
soul represented. thanks to this creation, Lognes, God of Matter and God of Antimatter
were all able to be given physical form.

--- Chapter 4 ---

Despite this, Lognes still chose to take the role of a spectator. Not letting his
presence be known yet still having total control. However, His world was growing.
It's presence became a lot more clear to omnipotent beings such as himself.
To protect his world, He armed himself with A limitless flow of Matter and Antimatter
on both sides of his body. This gave him the form which he is known for today.

--- Chapter 5 ---

(Okay everything beyond this point idk if it will stay)
An unfathomable presence entered lognes' world. This being was known as beepbox.
Lognes was powerless against it, though it meant no harm. The Being offered a deal
beepbox would lend its power so he could travel to other worlds. The catch being
he wouldn't have as much reign over other worlds as he does in his. seeing no
downside to the deal he accepted.

--- Chapter 6 ---

Lognes has met countless people bound by the same contract as beepbox.
All from their own worlds with their own stories to tell.
However, The beepbox had another goal. It was sending these people it had
under it's contract to a single world. this world having countless beings from
their own worlds collected within it. This world being the world of Aether.
Having no choice but to defend himself. Lognes partook in many battles.
