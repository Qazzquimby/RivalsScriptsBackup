/*An ex-soldier from the future. A master in hand to hand combat. In a future without Clairen, having escaped Neo Fire Capital, Penny is ready to defend her and her friends.

Penny is still very much in beta, not everything will stick. Please keep in mind that she is still in production, needs plenty of testing, and will probably need to be balanced a ton.

Things to Know:
* Penny was designed similarly to Project M Lucario. She has a magic system of combos that are essential for getting plenty of damage:
** Tier 1 - Jab / Dash Attack - These can combo into any of the other tiers on hit.
** Tier 2 - Tilts - These can combo into the tiers above, but not Tier 1.
** Tier 3 - Strongs / Aerials - These can only link into Tier 4.
** Tier 4 - Specials - Mostly going to be your finishers.
* Up Special can be angled. Pressing Special once more, during the start-up, will give it a spike towards the end. If the opponent DIs correctly, they will get hit with the sour spot.
* Down Special allows Penny to flow between Tier 3 moves, granting you more follow-up options. It also gives Penny a short window of invincibility, allowing you to approach with it.
* Side Special changes depending on if you're airborne or if you're grounded. If you're in the air, the move will send the opponent downwards. If you're on the ground, you'll send the opponent upwards.
* Neutral Special is similar to Terry's Power Wave. It travels on the ground and pops opponents up. It can also be used in the air for a much weaker disjoint tool.

Special Thanks to Ruby, Hinata, Sakamoto, and madman404 for their input and testing of Penny during her Alpha.
